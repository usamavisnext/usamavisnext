# 💻 About Me
Hi there! 👋 I'm Usam Amjad, a passionate AI/ML/DL researcher and developer. I specialize in building intelligent systems using Generative AI and Natural Language Processing. I also work extensively with LangChain, LangGraph, and both conventional and vector databases to craft efficient, scalable solutions. My primary coding tool is Python, and I enjoy creating robust web applications using FastAPI and Flask.

# 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL
- **AI/ML/DL Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Keras, LangChain, LangGraph
- **NLP:** spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Generative AI:** OpenAI, GPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Llama3.1, Llama3.2, Google Gemma2, Gemma3, Open-soruce models (HuggingFace), Ollama, Vllm, n8n, Agents
- **Tools for LangChain and LangGraph:** LangChain, LangGraph, Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Pinecone, Milvus
- **Web Frameworks:** FastAPI, Flask
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks
- **Other Tools:** Docker, Git, Jupyter Notebooks

# 🚀 Current Projects
1. **Generative AI for Creative Writing:** Using GPT to generate short stories based on user inputs.
2. **LangChain and LangGraph Application:** Developing a conversational AI system that leverages LangChain for multi-turn dialogue.
3. **Vector Database Search Engine:** Creating a semantic search engine using vector databases like Pinecone and Milvus.
4. **n8n, Agents, Multi-Agents System:** Developing Agents for real world applications using latest AI technologies.  

# 📚 I’m currently learning
- Advanced LangGraph techniques for enhancing conversation flow.
- n8n and latest AI treans and exploring new ways of implementing and developing AI applications and Agents.
- Exploring large-scale neural network deployment on cloud platforms.
- Diving deeper into reinforcement learning for robotics.
